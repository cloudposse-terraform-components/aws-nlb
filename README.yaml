description: |-
  Terraform component that wraps the [cloudposse/nlb/aws](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-nlb) module.
  It provides a Network Load Balancer with optional listeners and target groups.

  By default the component will lookup the VPC in the current stack unless `vpc_id` is passed in.

  By default the component will lookup the ACM Certificate from the component `acm` unless `dns_acm_enabled` is set to `true`, in which case it will lookup the certificate from the component `dns-delegated`.
  If neither are found the component will not bind to a certificate.

usage: |-
  **Stack Level**: Regional

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      nlb/basic:
        vars:
          enabled: true
          name: "nlb"
          # internal: false # default value
  ```

  Example passing in a VPC ID and subnets.

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      nlb/basic:
        vars:
          enabled: true
          name: "nlb"
          vpc_id: "vpc-xxxxxxxx"
          subnet_ids:
            - "subnet-11111111"
            - "subnet-22222222"
  ```
